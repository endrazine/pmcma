If you would like to contribute to pmcma, please first read the file called NOTICE.

Here is non exhaustive list of things to implement/fix in pmcma, in addition to
any new/cool hacking technique you may want to add.

- Fix x86_64 bugs in ASLR detection.
- Merge x86_64 shellcodes to handled kernels compiled without 32b compatibility.
- Add a human readable conclusion at the end of the audit.
- Merge code to handle exhaustive/selective invalid reads.
- Merge code to implement syscalls recording and automated ASLR leakage through
  invalid memory writes (doesn't work on x86_64 yet, descoped for now).
- Add code to handle stack overflows exploitation.
- Port to OSX, *BSD, ARM architectures
